# Solana Balance Checker

## Overview

Welcome to the Solana Balance Checker project! This is a beginner-level project that I created to understand the basic concepts of React and blockchain technology. The main goal of this application is to display the SOL balance of a given Solana wallet address, as well as any other token balances that may be present.

## Features

- **Display SOL Balance**: Enter a Solana wallet address to view its current SOL balance.
- **Token Balance Check**: The application can also check for other token balances associated with the wallet.

## Motivation

As a beginner in web development and blockchain, I wanted to build a simple yet functional application that would help me grasp the fundamentals of React, API integration, and working with blockchain data. This project has been a great learning experience, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting.

## Future Improvements

There are several enhancements I plan to implement in the future:

- **Better UI**: Improve the user interface for a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
- **Integrate .sol Domains**: Allow users to enter .sol domain names instead of wallet addresses for easier access.
- **Additional Token Support**: Expand the application to support more tokens and provide detailed information about each.
